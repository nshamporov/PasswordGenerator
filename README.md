??? Welcome to my Password Generator App ???

This app allows you to save your own passwords to the database or generate a safe 12 digit password and save it. With saving the password you save an account name where you gonna use the password with it. It allows you view the passwords in the database and copy them from there. You can later edit passwords in the database by using account name. You also can delete the passwords from the database when you don't need them anymore.


The requirements for this app are:
--MySQL Database
--Python installation
--tkinter library (which usually is installed with Python installation by default)
--mysql.connector library (which has to be installed with pip install mysql-connector-python)
--pyperclip library (which has to be installed with pip install pyperclip)


&&& I hope you like the app I have created, I also included the shortcut that you can use to start the app. &&&


$$$ Enjoy!
